## Overview
In this repository, we look into bom.movie_gross.csv.gz, im.db.unzipped and some scrapped data from the internet to gather information about films from 2010 to 2018. This dataframe contains 3386 entries with 6 columns.
## Business Understanding
Maximizing revenue and minimising risk is our upmost priority. Using 3 metrics, Revenue, Genre and Release Window, we will determine the safest way to produce films.

As you can see, Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi are the top grossing genres. Utilizing this genre along with the Hero's journey increases the films success significantly.
